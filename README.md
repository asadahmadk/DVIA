Using the grid system I have divided my prototype into 12 quadrants. Using the grid in this design allows to construct the argument objectively by giving options to the users. 
On the first top row will have a navigation bar for the users to go to home page, find location, filter days and see a tabular view. 
The user can sign in as well on the website for online meetings. [This is an assumptiion so this online will be a static page in the design]. 

To construct text and illustration on the design systematically, in the centre row on left, user will be able to enter the location, as it is not captured while viewing the webpage. 
This will keep user privacy intact. In the same section user will be able to select the meeting days, on which day they want to attend a meeting. This is a
filter allowing the user to user multiple days.

In the bottom left, to organize and keep the arrangement compact a slider of time will be added allowing the user to choose a time of their choice when they want to attend a meeting.

For the remaining six quadrants on the right a map of Manhattan will be visible, where after adding the details the results will be highlighted. When the user will hover the mouse over the location, 
they will be able to see the meeting details in a interactive window.

In this design there will be 6 divs as following:
1. Navigation Bar
2. Logo of AA and NYC
3. Enter your location
4. Day Selection
5. Time Slider
6. Map


Using the   grid in the design is  systematizes, rationalizes and integrates the elements required in the final design. When scroll on the mobile, the two columns on the 
grid will move together and two columns on right will go underneath. This will allow the user to enter the details and add filters first before looking at the
result displayed in the map.
